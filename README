Yoga App Project - End of Course Challenge: Implementing All the Steps to Create a Professional Prototype.

In this final stage I present the project I worked on throughout the course. It contains a Project Briefing, Design System, Wireframe and the navigable Mockup.
This fictional project was created as part of an evaluation for the ‘UX Designer Training’ course, taught by Professor Rodrigo Alexandre, on the DIO platform.
